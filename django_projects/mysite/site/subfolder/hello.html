    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create the structure, or skeleton of most web pages, and convey information to internet hosts about those pages. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements within a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, as well as meta information about the page's content such as its written language, associated files, and presentation. HTML works together with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.
